# Costs
* **Designer:** $35 -> $125 hr We get what we pay for.
* **Full stack Wordpress Devs:** $35 -> $150 hr Again we get what we pay for
* **Hosting:** $25 My recommendation is what I was using at LGL [ Wordpress Engine ](https://wpengine.com/plans/) They manage everything and provide simple point and click module updates. They have a curated list they know work.
